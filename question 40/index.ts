// Write a function called make_album() that builds a Object describing a music album. 
// The function should take in an artist name and an album title, and it should return a Object containing these two pieces of information.
// Use the function to make three dictionaries representing different albums. 
// Print each return value to show that Objects are storing the album information correctly.
// Add an optional parameter to make_album() that allows you to store the number of tracks on an album. 
// If the calling line includes a value for the number of tracks, add that value to the albumâ€™s Object. 
// Make at least one new function call that includes the number of tracks on an album.


// optional parameters indicated by the ? symbol after their names. 
// This allows you to call the function with fewer arguments without causing an error.

// interface is a way to define the shape or structure that an object should have.
