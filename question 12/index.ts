// Greetings: Start with the array you used in Exercise 11, but instead of just printing each person’s name, print a message to them. 
// The text of each message should be the same, but each message should be personalized with the person’s name.

let message = "you are very nice friend of me and you are special to me.";


// print names with message by for of loop

for (let i of names){
